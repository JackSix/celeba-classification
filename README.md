# cs274c-project

Purpose:
Project for Neural Networks and Deep Learning (CS274C) class at UC Irvine.

Idea:
The project is to look at how changing the batch size, instead of learning rate, will affect training a neural network.

Project members:
Galen and Quan

Relevent Papers:
TODO

Work:
(1) Obtain dataset that has images of people's faces, labeled with male/female
(2) Create NN in Keras similar to existing human-face-classification NNs
(3) Rework NN to allow for batch size to change as training progresses
(4) Create iOS app to take a saved Keras model and apply it to images taken by the phone
(5) Present work to class
